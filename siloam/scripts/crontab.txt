# Here is a suggested cron tab file to set up automated image file cleanup
# Please set up cron using cron.sh beforehand
# locate your crontab file and place the following into it!

# -------- standard cron preamble -----------
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command


# this cron job runs every 30 minutes
# it first looks under uploaded-images folder and deletes all files and subfiles that are older than 30 minutes
# then deletes all empty folders older than 30 minutes
30 * * * * sudo find /siloam-deployment/siloam/public/uploaded-images/* -type f -mmin +30 -delete && sudo find /siloam-deployment/siloam/public/uploaded-images/* -type d -empty -mmin +30 -delete

30 * * * * echo 'Ran image clean up service' >> /cronlogs/siloam.log
